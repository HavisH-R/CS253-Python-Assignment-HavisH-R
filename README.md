# CS-253 Python Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the Python assignment for the CS-253 course. The main focus of this assignment is to perform predictive modeling and data visualization based on a provided dataset.

## Files and Directories
- `main.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code for loading data, processing it, training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions. It includes detailed steps from data preprocessing to model optimization using GridSearchCV.

- `Data_plots/`: This directory contains all the data visualizations generated as part of the analysis. Each plot provides insights into different aspects of the dataset, such as criminal cases, wealth distribution among candidates, and other significant metrics.

## Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Ensure that Python 3 and Jupyter are installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.ipynb`.
3. Open this notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to observe the workflow from data loading to final predictions.

## Data
The data used in this assignment is stored in CSV format. Ensure that the CSV files are placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the paths in the notebook accordingly.
